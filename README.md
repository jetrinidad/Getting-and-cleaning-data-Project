# Getting-and-cleaning-data-Project

### Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained.

### Source data
The data and information about the variables are contained here

### Goal of project

1. To Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. To Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. To Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. To appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. To create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subjectf rom the data set in step 4

### Review Criteria


1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries    calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
